# Commits From Last Night
## Version 0.0.1

This project was inspired by [Commit Logs From Last Night](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/). 
I wanted to see what shenanigans my coworkers are up to in our internal company repos. 
I will be developing this project to interface with [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and I don't have any current plans to expand it to include GitHub. 
That being said, I have attempted to design the database in a style that should work for both. I won't guarantee anything will be properly abstracted though. 

I intend to play around with project in a non-serious manner so don't expect anything great.
