# Commits From Last Night
## Version 0.0.6

This project was inspired by [Commit Logs From Last Night](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/). 
I wanted to see what shenanigans my coworkers are up to in our internal company repos. 
I will be developing this project to interface with [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) 
but I plan to expand this to GitHub once I'm satisfied with the way it integrates with BitBucket.

One of the long-term goals of this project is to run different analytics on commit messages to provide insightful 
data about what programmers are thinking.

Whether that data will actually be insightful is still to be determined.
