# Commits From Last Night
## Version 0.0.1

This project was inspired by [Commit Logs From Last Night](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/). I wanted to see what shenanigans my coworkers are up to in our internal company repos. I will be developing this project to interface with [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and I don't have any plans to expand that to GitHub. 

I intend to play around with project in a non-serious manner so don't expect anything great.
