# Commits From Last Night
## Version 0.0.3

This project was inspired by [Commit Logs From Last Night](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/). 
I wanted to see what shenanigans my coworkers are up to in our internal company repos. 
I will be developing this project to interface with [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) 
but after much thought I plan to expand this to GitHub also.

One of the long-term goals of this project is to run different analytics on commit messages to provide insightful data about 
what programmers are thinking.

Whether that data will actually be insightful is still to be determined.
